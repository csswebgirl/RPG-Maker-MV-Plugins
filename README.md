# RPG Maker MV Plugins

These plugins are ones I have created for use in my own project(s). Most will require the use
of an additional plugin, and the plugin I created will modify that plugin for more customization.

**Note:** If you find a bug that is related to the additional plugin, please contact the creator
of **that** plugin and not me.

**Note:** All the created plugins are only for use with **RPG Maker MV v1.5.2 and below**. None have been
tested for use with any version above v1.5.2. Additionally, please note that each plugin that requires
another plugin to work will note which version of that plugin the modifying plugin has been tested with.
