# RPG Maker MV Plugins

These plugins are ones I have created for use in my own project(s). Most will require the use
of an additional plugin, and the plugin I created will modify that plugin for more customization.

All the created plugins listed are ONLY for use with **RPG Maker MV v1.5.2 and below**. None have been
tested for use with any version above v1.5.2. Additionally, please note that each plugin that requires
another plugin to work will note which version of that plugin the modifying plugin has been tested with.
If the plugin that is being modified requires a specific version, the modifier plugin may not
fully work if using a version above the specific version listed.

**Note:** If you find a bug that is related to the additional plugin, please contact the creator
of **that** plugin and not me.


## Installing Plugins

After downloading the plugin, place it in the plugins folder in your RPGMMV project. Open up RPGMMV, load your
project and install the plugin using the Plugin Manager tool.

**Note:** Make sure you place the modifying plugin
**BELOW** the plugin it is modifying if it is a modifying plugin.

**Additional Note:** If you are using [fallenangelolivia's](https://fallenangelolivia.itch.io/) OCTOPACK BATTLER PLUGINS,
place those plugins near the **bottom** of the plugin manager, underneath any and all other plugins, including all
modifier plugins, *except* any modifier plugins that are used to modify the OctoPack Battler Plugins themselves. Those
plugins go underneath *all* of the OctoPack Battler Plugins.
